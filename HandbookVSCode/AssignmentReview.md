# Assignment Review

## Quick overview of our assignment

 We learnt, and were reminded of alot of good and bad practices when writing this handbook. In the process of writing about all of these good practices and bad practices, we improved our own code reviews, and acknowledged improvements we would be implementing in our own code going forward. The assingment process overall was good. We met regularly and were comfortable with the git process as we completed the lab relating to the assignment. We also made templates so the handbooks content would remain consistent and little review was needed. With that being said, there is always room for improvement...

## Things we would change next time 

**More specific timeline planning**

- While the assignment ran smoothly, we had small issues where someone might be left not working on anything because the rest of the team were working on all files. To fix this, we could work on finer timeline planning not just dividing the tasks.

**More pictures in the handbook**

- A picture speaks a thousand words, we feel we could have utilised a few more pictures inside the handbooks content. We struggled to find fitting images for the respective points.
