# Code Reviews

## Quick Summary

A code review is the process where one or more developers look over someone else’s code before it’s merged into the main codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, catch bugs early, and share knowledge across the team.

## Do’s
- Review pull requests asap 
- State review content clearly
- Break down large tasks
- Review code thoroughly

## Dont’s
- Let pull requests sit idle
- Do not be vague in reviewing
- Don't overload a single commmit
- Skim blindly through reviews

## Full Guidelines for Best Practices

**1. Review other team members pull requests quickly**

Don't let pull requests sit idle. You should review pull requests shortly after they come in. Review them as soon as you have the chance to. If you’re not in the middle of a task, you should look at the pull request. Don’t leave pull requests longer than a day to review. 

**2. Communication is key**

The person who reviews the code must be clear with their comments, and state if their comment is personal preference or project guidelines. If the reviewer can provide an example from the same repository as a pull request, that is great. This helps enforce the point that is being conveyed by encouraging consistent implementations throughout the project.

**3. Keep changes small**

Code reviews often require a lot of time and effort by the reviewers. When developers try to implement too many changes in one commit, it can not only take longer to review but more reviewers may be required, taking time away from other project requirements. Developers should follow the rule: 1 ticket/issue = 1 code review. Any tickets that are too large should be broken down to become more manageable.

**4. Make sure reviews are high quality**

Even though we should do code reviews as fast as possible, it should not impact the quality. If your doing a code review, you should actually take the time to read through the review, understand the changes made and catch issues. You need to maintain a standard of high quality. Skimming through the pull request can cause little bugs to be missed.
