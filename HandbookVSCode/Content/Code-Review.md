## Full Guidelines for Best Practices

**1. Review other team members pull requests quickly**

Don't let pull requests sit idle. You should review pull requests shortly after they come in. Review them as soon as you have the chance to. If you’re not in the middle of a task, you should look at the pull request. Don’t leave pull requests longer than a day to review.
