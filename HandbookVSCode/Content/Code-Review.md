# Code Reviews

## Quick Summary

A code review is the process where one or more developers look over else’s code before it’s merged into the main codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, catch bugs early, and share knowledge across the team.

## Do’s
- Review pull requests asap 

## Dont’s
- Let pull requests sit idle

## Full Guidelines for Best Practices

**1. Review other team members pull requests quickly**

Don't let pull requests sit idle. You should review pull requests shortly after they come in. Review them as soon as you have the chance to. If you’re not in the middle of a task, you should look at the pull request. Don’t leave pull requests longer than a day to review. 

**2. Clarity is key**

The person who reviews the code must be clear with their comments, and state if their comment is personal preference or project guidelines. If the reviewer can provide an example from the same repository as a pull request, that is great. This helps enforce the point that is being conveyed by encouraging consistent implementations throughout the project.
