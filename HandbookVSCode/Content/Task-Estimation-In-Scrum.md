# Task Estimation in Scrum

## Quick Summary

Task estimation in Scrum is a collaborative process where the team assesses how much work is involved in each task. Instead of using precise time estimates, they compare tasks using measures like story points. This approach helps the team plan sprints effectively and manage workload by ensuring tasks are balanced.

## Do’s
- Use relative estimation
- Break down any story with high estimates
- Let everyone on the team collaborate
- Compare past estimations to actual work
- Focus on adaptability
- Use techniques to encourage team collaboration
- Treat estimate as prediction
- Balance effort and value for prioritization

## Dont’s
- Convert story points into hours
- Use estimates as performance metrics
- Tie estimates to external contracts/ rewards
- Skip retrospective review meetings
- Convert absolute time into story points
- Let individual biases override team input
- Treat estimate as a deadline
- Prioritize only on business value

## Full Guidelines for Best Practices

**1. Estimate tasks using story points, not time**

Use story points to compare the relative effort of tasks. Don’t convert story points into hours or days because this removes the flexibility and often leads to unrealistic expectations. Estimates should help with planning, not act as time-tracking tools or deadlines.

**2. Split large stories into smaller more manageable tasks**

Break down any story estimated at 13 points or more. Larger tasks usually hide unknowns and increase the risk of missing a sprint goal. Don’t allow for oversized stories into the sprint backlog without slicing them first. Should always try and aim for small, deliverable chunks that provide value and are easier to track.

**3. Use estimation as a team activity**

Involve the entire Scrum team when estimating. Everyone's input matters and having multiple different perspectives leads to better planning. Don’t let one person have the final say because it reduces collaboration and can lead to missed or overconfidence in estimates. It should be a team decision.

**4. Review and Refine Your Estimates Regularly**

After every sprint, take some time as a team to look back at how your estimates compared to the actual work. Discuss what was overestimated or underestimated during your previous meetings, and adjust your estimation approach for going forward. This helps your team make more accuarte predictions in the future.

**5. Avoid Frankenstein Estimates**

Developers should be careful about converting absolutute time estimates into story points. This undermines the fundamental agile principles of flexibility and adaptability. Practicing the Frankenstein estimates can introduce several problems, including loss of context and misaligning with agile values. 

**6. Utilise collaborative techniques**

Estimation techniques such as planning poker. I know, I know, boring. But this is the how behind the why of "Use estimation as a team activity".This is a technique used where each developer is equipped with a set of cards representing the Fibonacci sequence. After discussing a new task, each team member presents a card from their hand, facilitating a collaborative estimation process. This method encourages everyone to share their perspective and drives a more reliable consensus.

**7. Treat Estimates as Forecasts**

An estimate is a prediction, not a definite. In Scrum, story points help plan out the work load and timeline, but they are not a contract​. Many factors can change once development starts so you should avoid treating an estimate as an immovable deadline. Instead you should communicate that estimates have uncertainty.

**8. Include Effort in Prioritization Decisions**

Use story point estimates to help order your backlog, not just based on business value but also by considering the amount of effort required. Knowing the effort involved helps you decide whether to tackle several small tasks or one large complex task that might span multiple sprints. By balancing effort with value, your team can better prioritize items in the backlog.
