## Full Guidelines for Best Practices

**1. Estimate tasks using story points, not time**

Use story points to compare the relative effort of tasks. Don’t convert story points into hours or days because this removes the flexibility and often leads to unrealistic expectations. Estimates should help with planning, not act as time-tracking tools or deadlines.

**2. Split large stories into smaller more manageable tasks**

Break down any story estimated at 13 points or more. Larger tasks usually hide unknowns and increase the risk of missing a sprint goal. Don’t allow for oversized stories into the sprint backlog without slicing them first. Should always try and aim for small, deliverable chunks that provide value and are easier to track.

**3. Use estimation as a team activity**

Involve the entire Scrum team when estimating. Everyone's input matters and having multiple different perspectives leads to better planning. Don’t let one person have the final say because it reduces collaboration and can lead to missed or overconfidence in estimates. It should be a team decision.

**4. Review and Refine Your Estimates Regularly**

After every sprint, take some time as a team to look back at how your estimates compared to the actual work. Discuss what was overestimated or underestimated during your previous meetings, and adjust your estimation approach for going forward. This helps your team make more accuarte predictions in the future.
