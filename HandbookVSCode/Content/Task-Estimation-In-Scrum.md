# Task Estimation in Scrum

## Quick Summary

Explanation of topic

## Do’s
- Use relative estimation (story points etc.) instead of estimation in hours
- Break down any story that gets a high estimate (like 13 points) into smaller tasks

## Dont’s
- Don’t convert story points into hours as it defeats the purpose and leads to confusion
- Don’t use estimates as performance metrics to evaluate individuals/ teams

## Full Guidelines for Best Practices

**1. Estimate tasks using story points, not time**

Use story points to compare the relative effort of tasks. Don’t convert story points into hours or days because this removes the flexibility and often leads to unrealistic expectations. Estimates should help with planning, not act as time-tracking tools or deadlines

**2. Split large stories into smaller, manageable tasks**

Break down any story estimated at 13 points or more. Large tasks usually hide unknowns and increase the risk of missing sprint goals. Don’t allow for oversized stories into the sprint backlog without slicing them first, should aim for small, deliverable chunks that provide value and are easier to track
